Research on Fair Income Distribution 

Available datasets: https://www.lisdatacenter.org/our-data/lis-database/

Questions: 
1. How to process negative income?
2. The data available in LIS is quite different from the data available in World Inequality Database (where we got the pre-tax labour income data) in terms of time frame.
